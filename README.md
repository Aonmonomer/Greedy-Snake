## **_Description_**

### Project Greedy-Snake is a browser-based game that basically started with a short snake and a dot.

### Player will need to activate and navigate the snake with up, down, left, right arrow key to capture the dot.

### For each dot the snake captured, the snake will grow a bit longer and the score will go up by 10.

### But the game will end whenever the snake hit the wall of the board or hit its own body.
